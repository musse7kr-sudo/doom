    <h1>Top Ten Mistakes of Web Design</h1>

    <p>Since my first attempt in 1996, I have compiled many top-10 lists of the biggest mistakes in Web design.<br>
    See links to all these lists at the bottom of this article.<br>
    This article presents the highlights: the very worst mistakes of Web design. (Updated 2011.)</p>

    <p><b>1. Bad Search</b><br>
    Overly literal search engines reduce usability in that they're unable to handle typos, plurals, hyphens, and other variants of the query terms.<br>
    Such search engines are <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-for-senior-citizens/">particularly difficult for elderly users</a>, but they hurt everybody.<br>
    A related problem is when search engines prioritize results purely on the basis of how many query terms they contain, rather than on each document's importance.<br>
    Even though advanced search can sometimes help, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-visible-and-simple/">simple search usually works best</a>, and search should be presented as a simple box.</p>

    <p><b>2. PDF Files for Online Reading</b><br>
    Users hate coming across a PDF file while browsing, because it breaks their flow.<br>
    Even simple things like printing or saving documents are difficult because standard browser commands don't work.<br>
    Layouts are often optimized for a sheet of paper, which rarely matches the size of the user's browser window.<br>
    PDF is great for printing and distributing manuals and other big documents. Reserve it for this purpose and convert any information that needs to be browsed or read on the screen into real web pages.<br>

    <p><b>3. Not Changing the Color of Visited Links</b><br>
    A good grasp of past navigation helps you understand your current location.<br>
    Links are key to this process.<br>
    Users can tell which pages they've already visited if visited links change color.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/change-the-color-of-visited-links/">Usability implications of changing link colors</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/guidelines-for-visualizing-links/">Guidelines for showing links</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>4. Non-Scannable Text</b><br>
    A wall of text is deadly for an interactive experience. Intimidating. Boring. Painful to read.<br>
    <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/topic/writing-web/">Write for online</a>, not print.<br>
    To support scannability, use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subheads</li>
        <li>Bulleted lists</li>
        <li>Highlighted keywords</li>
        <li>Short paragraphs</li>
        <li>The inverted pyramid</li>
        <li>A simple writing style</li>
        <li>De-fluffed language</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>5. Fixed Font Size</b><br>
    CSS can disable a Web browser's "change font size" button.<br>
    About 95% of the time, this fixed size is <i>tiny</i>, reducing readability for most people over 40.<br>
    Respect user preferences and let them <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/let-users-control-font-size/">resize text</a>.</p>

    <p><b>6. Page Titles With Low Search Engine Visibility</b><br>
    Search is the main way users discover websites.<br>
    The humble page title is crucial to attract visitors and help users locate pages.<br>
    Use <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microcontent-how-to-write-headlines-page-titles-and-subject-lines/">microcontent</a> effectively.<br>
    Start titles with important information-carrying words, not "The" or "Welcome to".</p>

    <p><b>7. Anything That Looks Like an Advertisement</b><br>
    Users ignore elements that look like ads.<br>
    Avoid designs that resemble advertisements.<br>
    Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/">Banner blindness</a></li>
        <li>Animation avoidance</li>
        <li>Pop-up purges</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>8. Violating Design Conventions</b><br>
    Consistency is key.<br>
    Users rely on prior experience to navigate your site.<br>
    Jakob's Law: "Users spend most of their time on <i>other</i> websites."<br>
    If your site behaves unexpectedly, users feel insecure.</p>

    <p><b>9. Opening New Browser Windows</b><br>
    Opening new windows disrupts users.<br>
    They may not notice and get confused with the <i>Back</i> button.<br>
    Links should replace the current page instead of opening new windows unnecessarily.</p>

    <p><b>10. Not Answering Users' Questions</b><br>
    Web users are goal-driven.<br>
    Failing to provide clear information frustrates users.<br>
    The worst example is <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/show-price/">not listing the price</a> of products.<br>
    This applies to both B2C and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/b2b-usability/">B2B</a> sites.</p>
